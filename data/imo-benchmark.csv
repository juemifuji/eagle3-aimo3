imo-bench-combinatorics-100,"Grogg and Winnie are playing a game using a deck of $50$ cards numbered $1$ through $50$. They take turns with Grogg going first. On each turn a player chooses a card from the deck—this choice is made deliberately, not at random—and then adds it to one of two piles (both piles are empty at the start of the game). After all $50$ cards are in the two piles, the values of the cards in each pile are summed, and Winnie wins the positive difference of the sums of the two piles, in dollars. (For instance, if the first pile has cards summing to $510$ and the second pile has cards summing to $765$, then Winnie wins $ \$255$.) Winnie wants to win as much as possible, and Grogg wants Winnie to win as little as possible. If they both play with perfect strategy, find (with proof) the amount that Winnie wins.

imo-bench-combinatorics-081,"The Bank of Berlin issues coins made out of two types of metal: aluminium (denoted $A$ ) and copper (denoted $C$ ). Sophia has $255$ aluminium coins, and $255$ copper coins, and arranges her $510$ coins in a row in some arbitrary initial order.  Given a fixed positive integer $k \leqslant 510$, she repeatedly performs the following operation: identify the largest subsequence containing the $k$-th coin from the left which consists of consecutive coins made of the same metal, and move all coins in that subsequence to the left end of the row. For example, if there are $4$ aluminum coins and $4$ copper coins and $k=4$, the process starting from the configuration $A A C C C A C A$ would be
